.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-b
Buffer size storing the data until it has been written to stdout, in bytes.
.TP

12k means 12Kb (12×1024)
.TP
12m means 12Mb (12×1024²)
.TP
12g means 12Gb (12×1024³)
.TP
The parameter argument can be given with or without space (-b12m is equivalent to -b 12m).
.RE
.TP
.BR delay
Desired delay, in milliseconds.

.SH Example
To delay the output of command_A to command_B by 5 seconds:
.TP
.RE
command_A | delay 5s | command_B
.TP
If we need a 10Mb buffer:
.TP
.RE
command_A | delay -b10m 5s | command_B
.TP
As an illustration, the following command produces an input at several rates,
and prints the result, delayed by 1 second, tabulated:
.TP
.RE
{ for i in {1..15}; do sleep $(bc <<< "scale=1;$i/10"); echo $i; done } |
    tee /dev/stderr | sed -u 's/^/\t/' | delay 1s
.TP
To delay the output of command_A to command_B by 5 seconds:
.TP
.RE
ffmpeg -an -s 320x240 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 -f mpeg2video -b 1M - |
    delay 2s | vlc -
